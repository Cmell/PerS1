In this task, you will see two images on each trial. The first image will be a face, and the second image will be a word. The face is not important, but only signals that the word is about to appear. When the word appears, it is your job to identify the word as a good word or a bad word. If the word is good, press the "i" key. If the word is bad, press the "e" key.

If you get the answer wrong or take too long, you will have to press the spacebar to continue. But if you get the answer right, you will automatically start the next trial. This might feel fast at first, but keep paying attention! It will get easier.
</p>
<p>
Please identify good words by pressing "i" and bad words by pressing "e" as quickly and accurately as you can!
</p>
<p>
If you are ready, place your fingers on the "e" and "i" keys, and press the space bar to begin.
