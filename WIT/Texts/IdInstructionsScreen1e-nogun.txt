In this part of the task, you will see an image of an object on each trial. When the object appears, it is your job to identify it as a gun or a non-gun. If the object is a gun, press the "i" key. If the object is something else (such as a tool or a wallet), press the "e" key.

If you get the answer wrong or take too long, you will have to press the spacebar to continue. But if you get the answer right, you will automatically start the next trial. This might feel fast at first, but keep paying attention! It will get easier.
</p>
<p>
Please identify guns by pressing "e" and non-guns by pressing "i" as quickly and accurately as you can!
